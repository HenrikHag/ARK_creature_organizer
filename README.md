# ARK creature organizer

Wrote this script to calculate the best stats for creature offspring in the game `ARK: Survival Evolved`.  

---

# To run

Rewrite the files `ARK_dinos.txt` and `ARK_tools_taming.txt` with your own creatures and tools.  
Use the existing examples as a template.  
(Make sure the dino names for a specific dinotype don't contain copy's).  

Run in an IDE to show the plots and use the functions (like `Best_Creature(Creaturename, Stat)`).  

To show an example for all stats of Megatheriums (if they exist in `ARK_dinos.txt`), run:  
```console
py ARK_creatures.py
```
